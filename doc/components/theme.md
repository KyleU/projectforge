# Theming

Full theme support is provided, you can use the Project Forge UI to change your default theme, add new custom themes, or browse a catalog of hundreds of pre-built themes.

Project owners can use the admin settings (`/theme`) to configure the themes for your application. 

Users are also able to configure custom user-specific themes in the page at `/profile`.
