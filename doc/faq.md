## What is Project Forge?

[Project Forge](https://projectforge.dev) helps you build and maintain feature-rich applications written in the Go programming language.

It's a code-generation platform that uses modules, which are self-contained features for your app. 
All managed projects expose a web and CLI interface, and additional modules are available for everything from OAuth to database access.
