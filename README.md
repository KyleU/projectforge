[Project Forge](https://projectforge.dev) helps you build and maintain feature-rich web applications written in the Go programming language.

The projects that are managed by Project Forge are built for developer experience and runtime performance.

Project Forge was initially designed for my own personal projects, but over time has become generally useful. Project Forge itself is also a generated project.
